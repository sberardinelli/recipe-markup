<div class="introduction">
  <p> Nutella and cream cheese blend together perfectly for an indulgent
    cheesecake in this recipe. This recipe calls for the dessert to be baked
    at a lower temperature, so it remains smooth.
</div>
<h2> Ingredients: </h2>
<div class="ingredients">
<ul>
  <li>14 whole graham crackers
  <li> 6 tablespoons of melted butter
  <li> 32 oz. of cream cheese at room temperature
  <li> 1 ¼ cup of semisweet chocolate
  <li> 5 large eggs
  <li> 1 ¼ cups granulated sugar
  <li> ¼ cup unsweetened cocoa powder
  <li> 1 ½ cups Nutella
  <li> 1 cup heavy cream
  <li> 1 teaspoon vanilla </ul>
  </div>
  <h2> Directions: </h2>
  <div class="directions">
  <p> Preheat oven to <strong> 325℉ </strong> Place a pan full of water on the lower rack of the oven,
    so the heat in the oven is humid. In a food processor, grind graham cracker crumbs until
    they are crumbs. Add the butter, mix until moist. Press mixture into a 9-inch pan.
    Bake for ten minutes, and let it cool.
    <br> <strong> Note: </strong> Keep the oven on.</p>

    <p>In a seperate bowl,  beat the cream cheese until smooth.
      Add 8 oz. of melted and cooled semisweet chocolate. Gradually
      add in eggs, mixing them in as you add them. Add sugar, cocoa powder
      Nutella, cream, vanilla and beat until combined. </p>

  <p> Pour the batter into a cooled crust. Bake for about 1 hour, or until
      and the top is dry. Bake for one hour. Cool cheesecake completely.
      Refridgerate for four hours. When completely cooled, serve in serving plate. </p>

  <p> Place the rest of the chocolate in a heatproof bowl. Heat up the heavy cream
      in a saucepan until simmering. Pour over chocolate chips. Let sit for 3 minutes before stirring.
      Pour over cheesecake. </p> </div>
